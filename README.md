*DESCRIPTION* :  This is a simple chat application built in Java and implemented using VS Code. It consists of a server (ChatServer.java) and a client (ChatClient.java). 
              The server handles multiple clients using multithreading, allowing real-time communication between users. Clients connect to the server to send and receive messages,
              and I have used vs code.
